import Logo from './logo.svg'
import Announcement from 'react-announcement'

class Example extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <Announcement
          title="Here is your component"
          subtitle="The best announcement component for React is finally here. Install it in all your projects."
          link="https://github.com/kristofferandreasen/react-announcement"

      />
    )
  }
}
```

### Usage with optional properties

This example includes the two optional properties in the component.

The daysToLive property changes to cookie created by the component.
This way you can control how many days you want to wait before you show the announcement to the same user.

The secondsBeforeBannerShows property changes the amount of seconds a user wait before the announcement is presented.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import Logo from './logo.svg'
import Announcement from 'react-announcement'

class Example extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <Announcement
          title="Here is your component"
          subtitle="The best announcement component for React is finally here. Install it in all your projects."
          link="https://github.com/kristofferandreasen/react-announcement"
          imageSource={Logo}
          daysToLive={3}
          secondsBeforeBannerShows={20}
      />
    )
  }
}
```
